Updates:
1) Fixed 3D reconstruction pipeline issues
>> Now able to go from 2D images to 3D model using one script
2) Researched ways to compare two 3D models
>> One idea is to use Kabsch's algorithm to compare two lists of three-dimensional points
   and to figure out the best transform from one list to the other
>> Wrote script to get the list of 3D points from the 3D models and working to implement/test
   the algorithm

Next steps:
1) Figure out just how good Vuforia is get what metric I need to beat/match with my system
2) Continue implementation of 3D comparison subsystem

Updates:
1) Researched different software that can perform 3D reconstruction from a set of 2D images
2) Spent time using them and reading their documentation to figure out which software is the
   best for my purposes and which software is most easily automated using a programming script.

The next step is to start writing a script to automate the 3D reconstruction software so that
I can use it on the HoloLens to create 3D models of specific objects seen by the HoloLens cameras.

Updates:
1) Determined a way to display holograms relative to a real-world object based on the orientation shift from the model comparison subsystem
2) Spent time validating the model reconstruction subsystem 
3) Spent time testing and validating the system's data flow from the HoloLens to the server

Next Steps:
1) Test the entire system with a real-world example to see how well it works
2) Validate the major parts of the system prior to the thesis deadline (April 4th)

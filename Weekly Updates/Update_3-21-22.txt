Updates:
1) Worked on setting up the whole pipeline of data between the HoloLens and the external Python server
2) Created a model cropping script that uses density maps to remove the unnecessary points leaving only the object of interest with a little background in the 3D model

Next steps:
1) Use that transformation data to determine the object's orientation in the real world in a real-world example
2) Use Unity to display a hologram relative to the object given its orientation from the previous subsystems in a real-world example

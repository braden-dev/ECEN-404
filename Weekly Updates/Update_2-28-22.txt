Updates:
1) Spent more time researching algorithms that can compare two 3D models/point clouds
2) Got 3D model comparison software “working” (needs improvements)

Next steps:
1) Improve 3D model comparison software
2) Implement iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm for tight point cloud alignment
3) Interpret/utilize transformation data to be used in Unity
